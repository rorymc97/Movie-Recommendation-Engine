# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
I wrote a simple movie recommendation engine using Python and the SparkML library,
using 10 million ratings from 72000 users on 10000 movies, collected by MovieLens. I
trained the model using the ALS (alternating least squares) method and returned the 5
movies most tailored to that user. 

There are Python files as well as a Jupyter Notebook.

**Note: Pyspark will need to be installed using pip in order to run the project.
